       Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important festivals celebrated in India and across the world. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. During this festival, people decorate their homes with oil lamps, candles, and colorful rangolis. Families exchange sweets, burst fireworks, and worship Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity and happiness. Diwali brings joy, togetherness, and hope, making it a truly special occasion for everyone.
