Onam is the grand harvest festival of Kerala, celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm. It marks the homecoming of King Mahabali, whose reign is remembered as a time of prosperity and equality. The festival lasts for ten days and includes beautiful flower carpets called 'Pookalam', traditional dances, songs, games, and the famous Onam Sadya feast served on banana leaves.
Vallamkali, the snake boat race, is another highlight of this celebration. Onam brings together people of all communities, spreading happiness and unity.
