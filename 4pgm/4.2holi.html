      Holi, known as the Festival of Colors, is one of the most vibrant and joyful festivals celebrated in India. It signifies the arrival of spring, the victory of good over evil, and the spirit of unity. On this day, people throw colorful powders, splash water, sing, dance, and share sweets with friends and family. Bonfires, called Holika Dahan, are lit on the eve of Holi to symbolize the burning away of negativity. Holi spreads love, happiness, and togetherness among all communities.
