<p><i>Flowers are the most beautiful and important part of a<b> plant</b>, mainly responsible for reproduction.<br> They are the <u>reproductive structures of flowering plants</u> (angiosperms) and usually consist of four main parts:<br>  petals, stamens, carpels.<br> The bright colors and fragrance of <b>flowers</b> attract insects, birds, and other pollinators, which help in <i>transferring pollen from one flower</i> to another. brâ€º This process of pollination leads to fertilization, resulting in the formation of fruits and seeds.<br> Flowers not only play a vital role in nature's cycle but also hold great cultural, medicinal, and economic value for humans.. <br>
